# What is this repository?
We provide codes for reproducing the results reported in our paper [T. Ezaki, et al. "Towards understanding network topology and robustness of logistics systems", Communications in Transportations Research 2:100064 (2022)].

# How to use
- **simulate_optimal_transport.py** includes the main function of simulating the system.
- .py files starting from **"exp_..."** are execution codes for generating the results reported in the paper.

# Requirements
We confirmed that the codes can be run on Python 3.6 environment.
